And yet, as much as Curry is starring on the court for the reigning champs these days, he also continues to do so away from it.</p><p>Prior to a game in Atlanta at the beginning of the month, Curry <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/stephen-curry-meets-fan-disability-ahead-warriors-hawks-game\">made a disabled fan's day</a>. On Sunday, he did the same for the youth at Covenant House in Oakland.</p><p>As part of the Warriors' \"Season of Giving\" campaign, Curry surprised 40 youth at Covenant House in Oakland, which provides sanctuary and support for youth ages 18-24 facing homelessness and human trafficking.</p><p>Those present&nbsp;were unaware of Curry's involvement until he arrived to surprise them. In addition to spending several hours with the people of Covenant House, Curry also provided each of them with a new pair of Curry 5's (his signature shoe) and a catered meal from his wife Ayesha's restaurant, International Smoke.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502879372\">Sunday Storm Slated to Soak Bay Area</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>\"These are obviously good reminders of how blessed we are to be able to do what we get to do,\" Curry said afterwards. \"To put a smile on people's faces just by walking in the room, I'll never take that for granted.\"</p><p>Programs and services offered at Covenant House are aimed at providing youth the best chance for success in independence. But on a more basic level, it serves as a sanctuary for those that have nowhere else to go.</p><p>\"It's definitely important for us to give back to our community that supports us,\" Curry continued. \"We have, obviously, ample amount of resources, and the Bay, we support each other. That's been proven year after year.\"</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502848361\">Nat'l Weather Service Issues High Surf Warning Along Coast</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>Curry is in the midst of his 10th year with the Warriors, and he's consistently made community outreach a personal priority over his decade in the East Bay. Sunday's visit to Covenant House was just the latest example of his efforts to give back to the community that supports him, and it certainly won't be the last.</p></div></div></div><br/>Copyright CSN BAY"

Police pursued the van for about a mile on city streets; the van ran several stop signs and collided with another vehicle along the way.

A DMV spokesman said Shiomoto had already told staff she plans to retire by the end of the year.</p><p>It's the latest in a string of DMV errors related to rolling out the \"motor voter\" program that automatically registers eligible people who visit the department. In October, the DMV said about 1,500 people may have been incorrectly registered, perhaps including non-citizens. It also faced an audit over hourslong wait times.</p><p>Of the 589 people whose voter information was not transmitted, 329 were registering to vote and 260 were trying to change their address, Shiomoto said.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502718201\">Know Where Your Romaine Is From: Health Officials</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>The records arrived at the DMV after the Oct. 22 voter registration deadline but were either postmarked or signed before it, meaning they still should have been eligible. But the agency did not send those records to the secretary of state until Nov. 30, Shiomoto said.</p><p>\"This pause was due to a misunderstanding on the part of the department, for which we take responsibility,\" Shiomoto wrote.</p><p>Padilla called on Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom to appoint new leadership, saying in a Friday letter that \"the director of the DMV has lost my confidence and trust.\"</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502761621\">Priest Travels US Spreading Gospel, One Good Deed at a Time</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>His office is looking into whether the affected voters tried to cast provisional ballots, which are counted after they are verified, and if so, whether those ballots were rejected.</p><p>The small number of affected voters across the nation's most populous state means no election outcomes were affected, Shiomoto said. Padilla did not directly address that in his response letter.</p><p>His spokesman, Sam Mahood, said Padilla didn't know Shiomoto already planned to resign.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=112247469&type=gallery\">Best Christmas Movies of All Time</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p></div></div></div><br/>Copyright Associated Press"

I will work very hard and do my very best to make Mississippi very proud,\" she said.</p><p>Her supporters said the furor over her comments was overblown. They also stuck by her as a photo was circulated of her wearing a replica Confederate military hat during a 2014 visit to Beauvoir, the last home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502904031\">Fact Check: Trump's Distorted Reality in Expanding Probes</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>\"So many things are taken out of context,\" said Elizabeth Gallinghouse, 84, from Diamondhead, Mississippi. \"The fact that she toured Jefferson Davis's house. You or I could have done the same thing. They said, 'Put this cap on. Hold this gun.' It was a fun time. She wasn't trying to send any messages.\"</p><p>The contest caps a campaign season that exposed persistent racial divisions in America &mdash; and the willingness of some political candidates to exploit them to win elections. With Hyde-Smith's victory, Republicans control 53 of the Senate's 100 seats. The GOP lost control of the House, where Democrats will assume the majority in January.</p><p>In the final weeks of the runoff, Hyde-Smith's campaign said the remark about making voting difficult was a joke. She said the \"public hanging\" comment was \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" for a fellow cattle rancher. During a televised debate nine days after the video was publicized, she apologized to \"anyone that was offended by my comments,\" but also said the remark was used as a \"weapon\" against her.</p><p>\n      \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                                      \n                  <div id=\"embeddedVidWrapper1\" class=\"embeddedWrapper\">\n            <a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502759132&ext=lVx2ezk8QNv0&type=videoplayer&title=%27Late+Night%E2%80%99%3A+A+Closer+Look+at+Trump%E2%80%99s+Response+to+Cohen&desc=Seth+Meyers+takes+a+closer+look+at+President+Donald+Trump%27s+interview+in+which+he+desperately+tried+to+rebut+allegations+that+he+broke+campaign+finance+laws.\">\n              <span id=\"embeddedVideo01\" class=\"embedded video \" data-cid=\"502759132\" data-vid=\"lVx2ezk8QNv0\">\n                <span class=\"videoPlayButton  small \"></span>\n                <span class=\"videoOverlay\"></span>\n                                <img alt=\"[NATL] 'Late Night’: A Closer Look at Trump’s Response to Cohen\" src=\"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/320*180/myr_hlt_s6e036_772_acl_20181213-154477728054400002.jpg\" />\n              </span>\n            </a>\n            <p class=\"videoHeadline\">'Late Night’: A Closer Look at Trump’s Response to Cohen</p>\n            <span class=\"smallestTitle\">Seth Meyers takes a closer look at President Donald Trump's interview in which he desperately tried to rebut allegations that he broke campaign finance laws.

He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's \"dirty deeds\" out of \"blind loyalty.\"</p><p>It also came ahead of a Senate vote on the \"First Step Act,\" a criminal justice reform bill with broad bipartisan support. Earlier in the year, Kim Kardashian West not once but twice paid a White House visit on Trump to discuss prison and sentencing reform. Sentencing for drug crimes, treatment for opioid addiction, a loosening of cannabis laws, a Tesla probe, the Mueller investigation into the Trump campaign: Justice will remain top of mind into the new year.</p><p>\"These are stories that connect to the culture and to society across races, across classes,\" Sokolowski said. \"We get this word that filters in.\"</p><p>\n      \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                                      \n                  <div id=\"embeddedVidWrapper1\" class=\"embeddedWrapper\">\n            <a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502882441&ext=5w9AXDJNrl3M&type=videoplayer&title=Explosion+at+Japanese+Pub+Injures+Over+40+People&desc=The+explosion+happened+in+the+Northern+Japanesse+city+of+Sapporo+Sunday+evening.\">\n              <span id=\"embeddedVideo01\" class=\"embedded video \" data-cid=\"502882441\" data-vid=\"5w9AXDJNrl3M\">\n                <span class=\"videoPlayButton  small \"></span>\n                <span class=\"videoOverlay\"></span>\n                                <img alt=\"[NATL] Explosion at Japanese Pub Injures Over 40 People\" src=\"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/320*180/SAMPLE+TIMELINE.00_00_20_06.Still003.jpg\" />\n              </span>\n            </a>\n            <p class=\"videoHeadline\">Explosion at Japanese Pub Injures Over 40 People</p>\n            <span class=\"smallestTitle\">The explosion happened in the Northern Japanesse city of Sapporo Sunday evening.

Trump referred to \"obstruction of justice,\" a separate entry on the Merriam-Webster site, prompting a lookup increase of 900 percent over the same date the year before.</p><p>Searches for \"justice\" throughout the year, when compared to 2017, were up 74 percent on the site that has more than 100 million page views a month and nearly half a million entries, Sokolowski said. To be word of the year worthy, an entry has to show both a high volume of traffic and a significant year-over-year increase in lookups &mdash; as opposed to, say, a word that merely buzzed or felt lofty, he said.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502910181\">May to Argue 2nd Referendum Would Violate Public Trust</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>\"We are not editorializing. We looked at our data and we were ourselves surprised by this word,\" Sokolowski said. \"This is a word that people have been thinking about for this entire year.\"</p><p>The word \"justice\" comes from Latin, unlike a lot of the more emotional words that rose in Old English. Old English did have \"law,\" ''fair\" and \"right,\" but never \"justice,\" in reference to a system of laws.</p><p>\"It's not a coincidence that it comes from the 12th century, which immediately follows the Norman conquest. When the Normans invaded England they brought their language, Old French, which was basically the then-modern version of Latin. They brought their system of government and laws and imposed them on the people they conquered, and that's why all of the legal language in English today is Latin, just like the word justice,\" Sokolowski explained. \"It took the imposition of a system of laws to bring us the word justice.\"</p><p>\n      \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                                      \n                  <div id=\"embeddedVidWrapper1\" class=\"embeddedWrapper\">\n            <a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502813262&ext=Xs5iVuB_qeSV&type=videoplayer&title=Al+Roker+Looks+Back+on+40+Years+at+NBC&desc=Today+Show%27s+Al+Roker+is+celebrating+40+years+at+NBC%2C+and+he+takes+a+moment+with+old+pal+Janice+Huff+to+talk+about+his+history+with+WNBC%2C+the+memorable+storms+they%27ve+covered+and+that+infamous+Doppler+4000+promo.\">\n              <span id=\"embeddedVideo01\" class=\"embedded video \" data-cid=\"502813262\" data-vid=\"Xs5iVuB_qeSV\">\n                <span class=\"videoPlayButton  small \"></span>\n                <span class=\"videoOverlay\"></span>\n                                <img alt=\"[NY-NATL] Al Roker Looks Back on 40 Years at NBC\" src=\"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/320*180/Al_Roker_Looks_Back_on_40_Years_at_NBC.jpg\" />\n              </span>\n            </a>\n            <p class=\"videoHeadline\">Al Roker Looks Back on 40 Years at NBC</p>\n            <span class=\"smallestTitle\">Today Show's Al Roker is celebrating 40 years at NBC, and he takes a moment with old pal Janice Huff to talk about his history with WNBC, the memorable storms they've covered and that infamous Doppler 4000 promo.

The GAO shows more than half of all children who died on the job, were working in agriculture.</p><p>\n              </p><p>The GAO reports states \"...while we estimated fewer than 5.5 percent of working children worked in agriculture&hellip; this population sustained more than 50 percent of all work related-child fatalities from 2003 to 2016.&rdquo; work-related fatalities among children were in agriculture.&rdquo;</p><p>The report counted deaths among child workers only between ages 15 and 17. But the GAO said younger children, including those 12 or even younger do work, many of them in agriculture.</p><p>The GAO further states that issue of younger children working and the safety risks associated with that should be studied further.</p><p>\n              </p><p>\"There are today in this country children that are working in deplorable conditions and are not equally protected under our child labor laws,\" Roybal-Allard told the Investigative Unit in 2012. \"And these are the children who work in agriculture.\"</p><p>In a statement released after this report finally came out, the congresswoman said the GAO's findings are \"damning.\"</p><p>Here's the full statement provided by Roybal-Allard:</p><p>\n              </p><p>&ldquo;The GAO report&rsquo;s findings are damning.  This report confirms that child labor is contributing to a devastating amount of fatalities in the United States &ndash; disproportionately so in the agricultural sector.  In that industry, kids are often exposed to dangerous pesticides, heavy machinery, and extreme heat, and they are being killed as a result.  That is unacceptable.  Our government must take these findings as a call to action and build on them to collect more robust data on injuries and illnesses faced by children in America&rsquo;s workforce.  More than that, we urge the Trump administration and our entire federal government to protect our nation&rsquo;s youth.  That means enforcing policies that uphold the basic well-being of child workers, instead of rolling back child labor protections and lifesaving regulations.  But we will not wait for the administration to take the lead. In the Democratic Majority, we will conduct vigorous oversight to ensure existing laws are being properly enforced, and push for changes where necessary to keep child workers safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Roybal-Allard also says that the report confirms &rdquo;that children as young as 12 years old can be found working in the fields &ndash;and that has substantial health impacts on minors.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div><br/>"

Engineers pointed to the corners of those holes as under particular stress.</p><p>The expert who is overseeing the testing and analysis of the cracks, Robert Vecchio of LPI Inc., said the cracks began with &ldquo;a pre-existing defect that occurred during the fabrication.&rdquo; He said the investigation showed tiny cracks in every sample they looked at. Cracks that &ldquo;popped out&rdquo;  under stress. &ldquo;We found these small cracks throughout all the sections that were removed from the girders.&rdquo;</p><p>When the holes were cut with torches, he said, workers left behind rough surfaces. Such rough areas should be ground smooth under building codes. Ed Reiskin, head of Muni and a member of the Transbay Board, wanted to know whether the girders were fabricated according to code. But project officials would not answer that question, saying more study needs to be completed.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502715112&ext=&type=videoplayer&title=Transbay+Transit+Center+Reopening+Could+Be+Months+Away&desc=The+new+Salesforce+Transbay+Terminal+in+San+Francisco+is+expected+to+remain+closed+for+several+more+months+due+to+cracks+in+a+steel+beam+that+will+take+months+to+fix.+Pete+Suratos+reports.\">Transbay Transit Center Reopening Could Be Months Away</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;re a lot of open questions,&rdquo; Reiskin said after the meeting. &ldquo;I have confidence that we&rsquo;ll get to the answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Robert Hazleton, president of The Herrick Corporation, the firm that fabricated the beams, spoke after the meeting. He said the cuts were not called for in the original design plans and in some cases were  cut into the structures after they were already built &ndash; so they didn&rsquo;t actually serve as weld access holes as defined by code.  Documents show confusion about their purpose, location and specification.</p><p>Hazleton referred questions about their purpose to project designers, but acknowledged that whatever their role, the holes could have played some part in the cracks.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502654942&ext=&type=videoplayer&title=Salesforce+Transbay+Terminal+in+SF+Still+Being+Repaired&desc=The+new+Salesforce+Transbay+Terminal+in+San+Francisco+is+expected+to+remain+closed+for+several+more+months+due+to+cracks+in+a+steel+beam+that+will+take+months+to+fix.+Jean+Elle+reports.\">Salesforce Transbay Terminal in SF Still Being Repaired</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ultimately going to be considered a contributing factor,&rdquo; Hazleton said. &ldquo;I think that is going to be a focus. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of things on this job that we will look at, but that one in particular is unique, and because its unique, it&rsquo;s going to draw attention.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, a fix is in the works to bolt additional steel to the top and bottom of the broken girders, to reinforce them.</p><p>How long that will take and how much it will cost has yet to be determined, leaving the reopening date uncertain.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=501604241\">Salesforce CEO Donates &#36;6.1M to House Formerly Homeless</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p></div></div></div><br/>"

But the utility also said it found downed trees atop power lines in the same area.</p><p>In a 20-day supplemental report about both fires sent to state regulators with the Public Utilities Commission, the company identified the problem with a so-called C-hook that had secured a part of the 115,000-volt Caribou Palermo line to one of its transmission towers.</p><p>While noting its findings were \"preliminary,\" the company identified what it called a flash mark  on the tower where the line freed by the broken hook may have contacted the structure.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502220141\">State Legislator Wants PG&amp;E to Re-Inspect its Towers</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>Subsequent inspection found unspecified signs of \"wear\" where the hook was connected to a series of discs that served as an insulator between the line and the tower structure. The company did not elaborate.</p><p>At the next-door tower, meanwhile, the company found an anchor for its insulator to the line had come loose.</p><p>As for the second, Concow fire nearby, the company said crews checking near where it started discovered a pole and other equipment  \"on the ground with bullets and bullet holes at the break point  of the pole and on the equipment.\"</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"Investigative\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502035081\">Hook on PG&amp;E Tower Eyed as Cause of Deadly Camp Fire</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>That discovery was on Nov. 9, a day after the fire started. Three days later, another  patrol of PG&amp;E found downed wires and poles, as well as several snapped trees, including some on top of downed wires. The company did not say whether the apparent gunfire or the downed wires touched off the fire.</p><p>\"These incidents remain under investigation, and this information is preliminary,&rdquo; the company stressed. \"The causes may not be fully understood until additional information is available, including information that can only be obtained through examination and testing of the equipment retained by Cal Fire. PG&amp;E is cooperating with Cal Fire.\"</p><p>On Monday, the company announced it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/California-Utilities-Taking-Steps-to-Combat-Destructive-Wildfires-502421021.html\">expanding inspections to 5,500 miles of its transmission system</a> in fire prone areas, climbing or aerially inspecting some 50,000 poles and towers. The company announced it was bolstering weather monitoring and installing 600 new high-definition cameras to cover about 90 percent of fire threatened service territory.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=501602041\">PG&amp;E Data Shows Success of Shutting Off Power in North Bay</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>In a statement, the company said: &ldquo;The loss of life, homes and businesses in the Camp Fire is truly devastating. Our focus continues to be on assessing our infrastructure to further enhance safety, restoring electric and gas service where possible, and helping customers begin to recover and rebuild. Throughout our service area, we are committed to doing everything we can to further reduce the risk of wildfire.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div><br/>"

The tower has two arms holding out the &ldquo;jumper,&rdquo; a part of the line that&rsquo;s being shifted to another point at the top of the tower.</p><p>The arms each hold electrical insulators, which resemble a series of white discs. Authorities believe the fire started with the fracturing of a steel hook that holds up the insulators to the arms above. It is one of those hooks, sources with knowledge of the investigation say, that failed in high winds the morning of Nov. 8.</p><p>&ldquo;PG&amp;E failed to maintain the tower, and they have an obligation to do that -- and it means they are liable for this disaster,&rsquo;&rsquo; said attorney Dario de Ghetaldi, who is suing the utility over the fire.</p><p>\n      </p><p>Cal Fire would not comment for this story, citing the ongoing investigation. PG&amp;E would not address our information on the apparent cause, instead sending us a statement saying, &ldquo;The cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation. We continue to focus on assessing infrastructure, safely restoring power where possible and helping our customers recover and rebuild.&rdquo;</p><p>But Frank Pitre, another attorney who has sued over both wildfires and the San Bruno gas explosion, worries the hook failure is just more evidence that PG&amp;E is simply not able to deal with the risk posed by its system.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a red flag,&rdquo; he said, a warning that parts of the system could fail due to corrosion and fatigue from decades of service.</p><p>\n      </p><p>&ldquo;You have to a have a rigorous system of inspection, particularly when you have systems that are 50 years old or more. You can&rsquo;t just visually inspect these things.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>De Ghetaldi says PG&amp;E should have done those detailed inspections after 2012, when five towers collapsed during a winter wind storm. &ldquo;They should have taken a serious look at the entire circuit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after those five towers collapsed in 2012, and it appears they didn&rsquo;t do that. That&rsquo;s a big problem for PG&amp;E. And it&rsquo;s a big problem for the people who were killed, who were made homeless, and who were harmed in many ways.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div><br/>"

According to Gray, her gown's design, with its lava color and appearance, was influenced by Albay's iconic Mayon Volcano.</p><p>Gray's father is Australian, and she was born and grew up in Cairns, Australia.

Duterte raised even more controversy when he recently joked that he smoked marijuana to deal with his busy schedule of meetings with other Asian leaders at a regional summit.</p><p>\n      \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                                      \n                  <div id=\"embeddedVidWrapper1\" class=\"embeddedWrapper\">\n            <a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502759172&ext=j_xu8hblM_w1&type=videoplayer&title=%E2%80%98Tonight%E2%80%99%3A+Name+That+Song+Challenge+With+Miley+Cyrus&desc=Miley+Cyrus+and+Jimmy+Fallon+compete+as+they+try+to+guess+random+songs+The+Roots+are+playing+one+instrument+at+a+time%2C+including+Cyrus%27+own+%26quot%3BParty+in+the+U.S.A.%26quot%3B\">\n              <span id=\"embeddedVideo01\" class=\"embedded video \" data-cid=\"502759172\" data-vid=\"j_xu8hblM_w1\">\n                <span class=\"videoPlayButton  small \"></span>\n                <span class=\"videoOverlay\"></span>\n                                <img alt=\"[NATL] ‘Tonight’: Name That Song Challenge With Miley Cyrus\" src=\"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/320*180/tjfScreen-Shot-2018-12-14-at-7.12.50-AM.jpg\" />\n              </span>\n            </a>\n            <p class=\"videoHeadline\">‘Tonight’: Name That Song Challenge With Miley Cyrus</p>\n            <span class=\"smallestTitle\">Miley Cyrus and Jimmy Fallon compete as they try to guess random songs The Roots are playing one instrument at a time, including Cyrus' own &quot;Party in the U.S.A.&quot; (Published Updated 4:13 AM PST, Friday, Dec. 14, 2018)</span>\n          </div>\n                            </p><p>Asked what she thought about legalizing marijuana, Gray said: \"I'm for it being used for medical use, but not so for recreational use.

That's a change from what the president said before. Trump previously had denied knowledge of payments and dismissed any hint of a crime.</p><p>In the special counsel's probe into contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, Trump tried to cast doubt on whether his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI. Flynn in fact pleaded guilty to doing just that.</p><p>Over the past week, Trump also made a flurry of false or unsupported statements about immigration. He said, with no evidence, that migrants are plagued with disease. He asserted that Mexico has in effect agreed to pay for his border wall, even as he threatens a partial government shutdown if Congress doesn't approve billions of dollars to build it. He twisted federal statistics to claim the recent arrest of 10 terrorists who don't exist.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502904881\">Saudi Arabia Rejects US Senate's 'Interference' in Kingdom</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>A look at the claims:</p><p><b>COHEN<br>TRUMP:</b> \"Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &amp; unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started.

And Trump is wrong about the government recently catching 10 terrorists.</p><p>His statement is a mangling of federal statistics showing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection stopped an average of seven to 10 people a day in the 2017 budget year who were denied entry to the U.S. because they were on a watch list. That average applied to all points of entry, and overwhelmingly from airports, and was not specific to the southern border. The standard for placing someone on the list is reasonable suspicion, a lower bar than the probable cause needed to arrest someone for an alleged crime. The statistics do not show how many might have been arrested or charged with anything.</p><p>In any event, Trump rendered a daily average as 10 recently captured terrorists in the flesh.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502859342\">Loyalty, Rapport: Why Trump Chose Mulvaney as Chief of Staff</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>As for border security, U.S. arrests on the Mexican border jumped 78 percent in November from a year earlier to the highest level in Trump's presidency.

The unemployment rate for men aged 20 and above fell last month to 3.3 percent, the lowest in 18 years. The rate for Americans with just high school diplomas dropped to 3.5 percent, the lowest since December 2000. The African-American jobless rate declined to 5.9 percent, matching May's figure as the lowest on record.</p><p>That's making it more challenging for businesses to find the workers they need.

(Published Updated 12:34 PM PST, Saturday, Dec. 8, 2018)</span>\n          </div>\n                            </p><p><b>THE WALL<br>TRUMP:</b> \"I often stated, 'One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.' This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly &amp; anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\" &mdash; tweet Thursday.</p><p><b>THE FACTS:</b> This is a face-saving statement to mask the fact that Mexico refused to pay for a U.S. border wall, Trump gave up trying to make it do so and U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for it.</p><p>In essence, Trump is arguing that new terms of trade with Mexico will increase economic growth in the U.S. and produce more tax revenue. That's what everyone hopes trade agreements will do. As part of that, he hopes for a lower trade deficit with Mexico. Neither outcome is assured.</p><p>\n              </p><p>The deal negotiated with Mexico and Canada is an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement he railed against, not a transformative pact. The three countries will continue trading in an environment of mainly low or no tariffs, with improvements here and there for all three partners. There is no credible way for Trump to forecast additional growth covering costs that are being charged to U.S. taxpayers if the wall is built. Trade balances depend on too many factors &mdash; consumer tastes, exchange rates, overall economic performance, and the choices of thousands of companies among them &mdash; and some are well outside any government's control.</p><p>Trump specifically promised in the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is not the same as trying to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which is about the exchange of goods and services among private entities rather than payments between governments. Nor is a trade deficit necessarily a penalty on consumers. It is the result of consumers buying things made in another country.</p><p>He wants some $25 billion from Congress for wall construction over five years and promises a partial government shutdown if he does not get a $5 billion or so portion in the next week. Congress may or may not give him that. If it does, it will not be because lawmakers expect a refund to the treasury in future years from extra growth produced by a trade deal.</p><p>\n              </p><p><b>TRUMP:</b> \"Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built.\" &mdash; statement in meeting Tuesday with Pelosi and Schumer.</p><p><b>TRUMP:</b> \"People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built.\" ''We have already built large new sections &amp; fully renovated others, making them like new.\" &mdash; tweets.</p><p><b>THE FACTS:</b> Tremendous portions of the wall have not been built. Yes, some barrier renovation has happened, but little wall construction has been completed under Trump.</p><p>\n              </p><p>Congress allocated roughly $1.4 billion in the spring &mdash; a bit more than 5 percent of what Trump wanted &mdash; for border security and specified that the money was not to be used for construction of the prototype wall sections that stand near San Diego. Instead, the money is to strengthen or replace existing fencing with more secure fencing.</p><p>Altogether, Trump promised in the campaign that he'd build a 1,000-mile (1,600 kilometer-) wall, as high as 40 feet or 12 meters (and have Mexico pay for it, which isn't happening). If some 650 miles (1,050 km) of existing fencing are considered in the equation, that leaves him with about 350 miles (560 km) of wall to build.</p><p><i>Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Eric Tucker, Chad Day, Lauran Neergaard, Josh Boak, Matthew Daly, Colleen Long and Elliot Spagat contributed to this report.</i></p><p>\n              </p></div></div></div><br/>Copyright Associated Press"

Mulvaney accepted &mdash; and even kept his current position as director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>Trump had made clear to confidantes that, for his third chief of staff, he wanted someone that he liked personally and who would not try to rein him in as John Kelly had during the first months of his soon-to-sour tenure. Trump missed the more freewheeling feel of the Oval Office under his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and wanted someone he could get along with &mdash; someone he could trade gossip with, who would complain along with him about his favorite subject, the \"fake news,\" as well as someone with the political savvy he felted Kelly lacked.</p><p>But Mulvaney was not always fond of Trump. At a November 2016 event in South Carolina, Mulvaney said \"Do I like Donald Trump?

Over a dinner last summer during a bout of deliberations about Kelly's future, Mulvaney told Trump that was interested and vowed to manage the staff and not the president, an answer Trump liked, according to a White House official and a person familiar with the dinner who were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.</p><p>Having grown increasingly weary of aides who would tell him no, Trump felt aligned with the man he had appointed OMB director. He also had become personally fond of Mulvaney as the two met to discuss budget matters and played golf together. The president, who has little patience for lengthy briefings, also appreciated the colorful maps and graphics the budget director would use to highlight his presentations. And he considered Mulvaney a natural on television.</p><p>During one particularly memorable televised Cabinet meeting, Mulvaney discussed his efforts to overhaul government regulation by explaining, in dramatic exasperation, that the Food and Drug Administration regulates cheese pizza, but not if one adds pepperoni, and that an open-face roast beef sandwich comes under different jurisdiction than one with two slices of bread.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502904881\">Saudi Arabia Rejects US Senate's 'Interference' in Kingdom</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>\"This is stupid,\" said Mulvaney at the end of his colorful monologue.</p><p>Trump loved the performance.</p><p>\"That was incredibly said,\" Trump marveled, telling the assembled press, \"I think you should put that on television, not what I said.\" For Trump, who rarely likes to cede the spotlight, it was an especially notable comment.</p><p>\n      \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                                      \n                  <div id=\"embeddedVidWrapper1\" class=\"embeddedWrapper\">\n            <a href=\"nbcba://embed?id=502688472&ext=I_WcieUPwA7n&type=videoplayer&title=Cohen%2C+National+Enquirer+Admit+to+Trump+Payoffs&desc=Trump+allies+Michael+Cohen+and+American+Media+Inc.%2C+the+owners+of+the+National+Enquirer%2C+both+admitted+to+paying+off+women+who+claimed+to+have+had+affairs+with+President+Donald+Trump+to+help+with+his+2016+presidential+campaigns+-+something+Trump+continued+to...\">\n              <span id=\"embeddedVideo01\" class=\"embedded video \" data-cid=\"502688472\" data-vid=\"I_WcieUPwA7n\">\n                <span class=\"videoPlayButton  small \"></span>\n                <span class=\"videoOverlay\"></span>\n                                <img alt=\"[NATL] Cohen, National Enquirer Admit to Trump Hush Money Payoffs\" src=\"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/320*180/Screen+Shot+2018-12-13+at+10.36.38+AM.png\" />\n              </span>\n            </a>\n            <p class=\"videoHeadline\">Cohen, National Enquirer Admit to Trump Payoffs</p>\n            <span class=\"smallestTitle\">Trump allies Michael Cohen and American Media Inc., the owners of the National Enquirer, both admitted to paying off women who claimed to have had affairs with President Donald Trump to help with his 2016 presidential campaigns - something Trump continued to...

He drew attention from his first day on the job, when he mounted a roan gelding to ride across Washington's National Mall to the Department of Interior.</p><p>Zinke had remained an ardent promoter of both missions, and his own macho image, despite growing talk that he had lost Trump's favor. On Tuesday, Zinke appeared on stage at an Environmental Protection Agency ceremony for a rollback on water regulations. Mentioning his background as a Navy SEAL at least twice, he led the audience in a round of applause for the U.S. oil and gas industry.</p><p>Trump never established a deep personal connection with Zinke but appreciated how he stood tall against criticisms from environmental groups as he worked to roll back protections. But the White House concluded in recent weeks that Zinke was likely the Cabinet member most vulnerable to investigations led by newly empowered Democrats in Congress, according to an administration official not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502904881\">Saudi Arabia Rejects US Senate's 'Interference' in Kingdom</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>His tenure was temporarily extended as Interior helped with the response to California wildfires and the West Wing was consumed with speculation over the future of chief of staff John Kelly. But White House officials pressured him to resign, the official said, which he did after his final public appearance at his department's Christmas party on Thursday night.</p><p>As interior secretary, Zinke pushed to develop oil, natural gas and coal beneath public lands in line with the administration's business-friendly aims. But he has been dogged by ethics probes, including one centered on a Montana land deal involving a foundation he created and the chairman of an energy services company, Halliburton, that does business with the Interior Department.</p><p>Investigators also are reviewing Zinke's decision to block two tribes from opening a casino in Connecticut and his redrawing of boundaries to shrink a Utah national monument.

In the part of the case with greater political repercussions, he also admitted breaking campaign finance laws in arranging payments in the waning days of the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels and McDougal, both of whom said they had sexual encounters with Trump, which the president denies.

Unanswered goals, missed calls, and both starting netminders out of the game before the first intermission.</p><p>After a loosey-goosey start that put them in a two-goal hole, the Sharks tightened up their game, roared back against a downtrodden Blackhawks squad and left Chicago with a 7-3 victory.</p><p>Seven different Sharks scored goals in the win.</p><p>Here are three takeaways from the whacky game:</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502879372\">Sunday Storm Slated to Soak Bay Area</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p><b>Special teams came up big:</b> San Jose had an opportunity in front of them on Sunday, given that Chicago&rsquo;s special teams are some of the worst in the league. As the Sharks battled to rally back from a 2-0 deficit, their special teams came up huge.</p><p>It started at the end of the first period when San Jose was on the penalty kill with both Evander Kane and Timo Meier in the box. The kill carried over into the second stanza, and the Sharks clearly gained momentum from it. The Blackhawks visibly began to unravel, which led to David Kampf going to the sin bin for playing with a broken stick. That&rsquo;s when the Sharks&rsquo; power play took over, and after a shift with really good puck movement, Kane found the back of the net.</p><p><b>Second period magic:</b> The second period has given the Sharks major headaches this season. But on Sunday, their second 20 showcased the things that make San Jose successful.</p><p>\n                              <div class=\"embedded article\">\n              <ul class=\"\">\n                <li><a href=\"nbcba://article?id=502848361\">Nat'l Weather Service Issues High Surf Warning Along Coast</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n                              </p><p>After a first period where Chicago&rsquo;s speed dominated the game, San Jose tightened up and got back to playing a more detailed defensive game. The shift in their game interrupted Chicago&rsquo;s flow, and the Blackhawks began struggling while hemmed in their own zone. The result: three unanswered goals that gave the Sharks a 5-3 lead before the second intermission.</p><p><b>Goal-front presence pays off:</b> One aspect of the Sharks&rsquo; offense that is really paying dividends is their presence in front of the opposition&rsquo;s net. Posting up in the goaltender&rsquo;s grill is perfect for rebounds and redirects -- which is exactly how the Sharks scored their goals on the evening.</p><p>San Jose&rsquo;s fourth line was particularly good in this area. They were really good in many areas, to be honest, but the way they posted up in front of Chicago netminder Cam Ward was especially impressive.
